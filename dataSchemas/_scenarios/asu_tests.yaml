  description:
    # - Sitrep - Complete Injury, Vitals, and Observations data are available for all patients.
    # - Assign LIFE triage scores and triage categories to patients
    # - Assign relative Medical Triage priority to all patients.
    # - Sort patients by triage category then triage score.
