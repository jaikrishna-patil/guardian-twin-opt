# QUESTIONS: 
# 1. Should we plan for fine grain triage algo user setting control for various phases of care? 
    # eg. Some algos enabled/applicable for Primary, but not for Prolonged Field Care? 
    # eg. Some algos low priority in Primary, but high priority in Prolonged Field Care?
# 2. Do the ranges for the triage categories make sense?
# 3. Are the error messages clear and helpful?
# 4. Are the descriptions clear and helpful?
# 5. Any other fields needed?
