# PURPOSE: This file defines the triage categories for medical emergencies, including their labels, descriptions, priorities, colors, and estimated survival times.
# Each category is assigned a unique identifier (triage_category_id) for reference.
# The categories are organized by priority, with Immediate patients requiring the most urgent care and Uninjured patients needing no intervention.
# The estimated survival time, resource consumption, and return to duty time are also provided for each category.  
# These estimates can vary based on individual circumstances and will be overridden by actual medical assessments.
# The Unknown category is included for patients whose condition requires further evaluation.
