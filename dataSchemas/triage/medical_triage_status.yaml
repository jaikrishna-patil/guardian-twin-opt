# Schema: Medical Triage Status
# Purpose: Define the schema for the medical triage status of a patient.

# Each time the isop_state.patient_record is updated with a timestamp that include new data required by a triage algorithm, the medical_triage status should be updated with the most recent triage category, priority, and confidence score.
isop_state:
  isop_id: <uuid>
  medical_triage:
  - timestamp: <datetime>
    category: <string> # immediate, urgent, expectant, delayed, minor, uninjured, unknown. Assign based on Triage algo/score
    priority: <string> # eg 2.2.52 If patient is Urgent = 2, has only NISS available and NISS algo ranked 2, and NISS score is 52
    confidence_score: <float> # 0-100, based on the quality of the data used to assign the triage category, eg. was the GCS score directly observed or inferred? was the SBP directly observed or inferred from casualty simulation data?

# LIFE Score ================================================================================================
# Requires NISS and RTS scores


# RTS =======================================================================================================
# Requires GCS, SBP, RR  NOTE if not available directly then there are a few options...
# - GCS can be inferred via communication with ISOP...Q: "Do they appear coherent?", then GCS = 13-15, "Is their speech slurred?", then GCS = 8-12
# - SBP and RR can be estimated via casualty simulation data based on known injuries, specific ISOP physiology, and known interventions
# - RR can be validated via communication with ISOP...Q: "Count your breaths for 30 sec and let me know what you get..." or Q: "What does their breathing sound like?" [normal, rapid and shallow, difficult and raspy, etc]

# NISS ======================================================================================================
# Requires Insult Type, Location, AIS
#     - "Describe your injuries. Include the type of injury, the location, and severity."
